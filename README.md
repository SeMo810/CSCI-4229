## CSCI 4229

This is the repo for Sean Moss, for CSCI 4299 - Computer Graphics, CU Boulder Fall 2015.

All code contained within is authored by Sean Moss, unless otherwise stated. Code based off of examples from class or off of the internet will be noted in the code files. While the class is traditionally done in C/C++, my code will be in C#, because I frankly like that language more. I will be using the OpenTK library, because it is a very low level wrapper around the C++ OpenGL library. Syntactically, the OpenTK library function calls are nearly identical to their C++ counterparts, hopefully making the code easier to follow for those not familiar with C#.
